Decision analysis for benefit-risk

This is an RShiny application for conducting a quantitative benefit-risk analysis of treatment alternatives using multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). The app requires as input a summary dataset (in .csv format) on all criteria (benefit and risk outcomes) for each alternative to be compared. Results of the analysis are displayed in interactive visualizations within the app and also available in the form of a downloadable report generated after all the analysis have run. 

Steps to carry out a quantitative benefit-risk analysis:
1. Begin by uplodaing the data and defining relevant fields using the 'Data Source' Item on the sidebar. Once uploaded you can view the Data on the 'Arranged Data' tab.
2. Continue to 'Range and Utility' item on the sidebar to define the range of plausible values for the criteria and the utility functions.
3. Continue to 'Weights' item on the sidebar to define the weights for each criterion.
4. Go to the analysis items (MCDA / pMCDA / SMAA) on sidebar to run each analysis.
5. After running all analysis, generate a report using the 'Generate Report' item on the sidebar.
